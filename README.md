# FIRST Team 2655 Battery Test Database

This repository contains battery performance data collected using an HP 6050A Electronic Load. Each battery's performance was measured by applying a constant 18A load and measuring the battery voltage over time. The load was disconnected from the battery once the battery voltage dipped below the threshold voltage for more than 10 samples (~1 second). 

The data logging GUI used for these tests is located [here](https://github.com/MB3hel/HP6050AGUI)
